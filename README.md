# Classifier - Fun times with Python, Docker, and Mongo

- This app is an attempt to build an app that displays classification results of submitted data.
- To run the app locally:
  1. Run the command `cd hello_app`, to change into the folder that contains the Flask app.
  1. Run the command `set FLASK_APP=webapp` (Windows cmd) or `FLASK_APP=webapp` (macOS/Linux) to point to the app module.
  1. Start the Flask server with `flask run`.
